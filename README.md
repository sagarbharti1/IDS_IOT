# IDS_IOT

ToN_IoT Intrusion Detection with LSTM and PFI

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting network intrusions using the ToN_IoT dataset. The approach involves preprocessing the dataset, performing feature selection using Permutation Feature Importance (PFI), handling class imbalance with SMOTE, and training an LSTM model for classification.

ðŸš€ Features Implemented

Data Preprocessing: Normalization using MinMaxScaler.

Feature Selection: Uses PFI (Permutation Feature Importance) to select the top 15 most important features.

Class Imbalance Handling: Oversampling using SMOTE.

Deep Learning Model: LSTM-based neural network for binary classification.

Performance Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix visualization.
